# VNF Asterisk

In this repository you'll end up finding a mish-mash of information around a
project that @dougbtw and @leifmadsen are working on. For this project, we
intend to build out an Asterisk-based VNF (virtual network function).

This VNF will not be intended to be deployed to production, but rather provide
a set of reference material and examples of how you might go about building
one. You can think of this as more of a demo or research project.

More information to follow as work progresses.
